# Why Use an LLM for Radiation-Tolerant Computing?

As Space-Radiation-Tolerant grows and the need for fault tolerance grows for space a LLM can serve as educational and streamline production speed if customized. Due to token structure and how a model is able to learn and access data is different amongst many popular Agents a custom fault tolerant agent is needed now the most especially when onboarding, debugging, and assist in software.

- **Automated Code Analysis:**  
  An LLM can quickly review and analyze large codebases for patterns, vulnerabilities, or best practices specific to radiation-tolerant design. Automating the framework can help for deeper coverage checks and edge case handling to prevent system failure. Its crucial to be careful in a mission critical system.

- **Knowledge Integration:**  
  The LLM can synthesize information from research papers, documentation, and code, providing actionable insights and recommendations. Many papers and research contributed to the development of RadML. A up to date agent on science can lead to higher learning rate for a developer as well as production speed. From an educational standpoint having an agent similar to a radiation expert can be very helpful. The model would need to be trained extensively and be able to perform well mathematically. Currently the knowledge area being planned is the CMake build before PyTorch integration.

- **Accelerated Development:**  
  Developers can query the LLM for guidance on implementing radiation-hardened algorithms, error correction techniques, or hardware-software co-design. Various chips are planned for production and already exist withing the edge AI market. Streamlining chip data and integration will be important. 

- **Documentation and Q&A:**  
  The LLM can answer technical questions, generate documentation, and help onboard new contributors to complex radiation-tolerant systems. Education is important and a tool is mandatory to help people learn at whatever pace they choose.

- **Continuous Learning:**  
  As RadMLs codebase and research continues to grow, a LLM can be retrained or fine-tuned to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and project-specific knowledge. Ollama is the current plan but hopefully with a good foundation it can be easily manageable.
